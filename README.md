# personal-guide-fedora

This repository aims to keep track of every installation/process I make in my fedora setup. This way, I can always come here and check how I did something.

## General commands

- Set pcmanfm as default file manager:
```
xdg-mime default pcmanfm.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search
```
